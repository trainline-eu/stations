Please note: Changes to station names here not only impact what is shown in the search widget and booking flow, but also the SEO landing page URLs. For more info please see [this wiki](https://wiki.thetrainline.com/display/VUL/SEO+Station+Slugs+solution) on how the "SEO slugs" logic is implemented and the impact of updating a station name.
